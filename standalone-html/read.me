Overview
The MSLR Formatting toolkit consists of two components:

A Word template with predefined styles (MSLR_Enhanced_Template.dotx)
A browser-based text formatter for smart quotes, em dashes, and heading detection

This approach eliminates cross-platform compatibility issues and avoids browser security restrictions.
Getting Started
Requirements

Microsoft Word (any modern version)
A web browser
Your draft article text

Installation

Download the MSLR_Enhanced_Template.dotx file
Download the formatter.html file
No other installation required!

Workflow
Step 1: Prepare Your Content

Draft your article in any word processor or text editor
Ensure proper structure:

Use consistent heading notation (I., A., 1., a., i.)
Place footnotes where they belong in the text
Clearly indicate your title, author info, and abstract



Step 2: Use the JavaScript Formatter

Open the HTML tool in any web browser
Enter metadata:

Article title
Author name
Choose footnote symbol (asterisk or dagger)
Enter author footnote text


Process your content:

Paste your draft text into the left panel
Select formatting options (smart quotes, dashes, headings)
Click "Format Text"
Review the formatted output in the right panel
Click "Copy to Clipboard" when satisfied



Step 3: Apply Template Formatting

Open the MSLR_Enhanced_Template.dotx in Word
Create a new document based on the template
Paste your formatted text from the clipboard
Apply styles from the template:

Find text marked with # and apply "Heading 1" style
Find text marked with ## and apply "Heading 2" style
Find text marked with ### and apply "Heading 3" style
Find text marked with #### and apply "Heading 4" style
For block quotes, select text and apply "Block Quote" style


Add proper footnotes:

For each footnote reference, use Insert → Footnote
Copy the footnote text into the footnote area
The first footnote will automatically use your chosen symbol


Generate Table of Contents:

Place cursor where TOC should appear
Go to References → Table of Contents
Select the pre-formatted TOC style


Set up headers and footers:

Double-click in the header area
Enter journal information on left, page numbers on right



Step 4: Final Formatting and Review

Check document settings:

Verify page size is 6" × 9"
Confirm 1" margins all around


Review formatting consistency:

Ensure all headings use correct styles
Check footnote formatting and numbering
Verify paragraph indentation and spacing


Perform final cleanup:

Update Table of Contents (right-click → Update Field)
Check for any remaining formatting issues
Run spell check and proofread


Save the finished document:

Use File → Save As
Name it appropriately (e.g., "LASTNAME_Article_MSLR.docx")

JavaScript Formatter
The formatter.html file is a standalone tool that helps prepare your text for the Word template by:

Converting straight quotes ("') to curly quotes ("" '')
Converting double hyphens (--) to em dashes (—)
Detecting headings based on outline format (I., A., 1., etc.)
Adding markdown-style heading markers for easy style application
Formatting title and author information

Troubleshooting
Q: The template styles aren't showing in my Styles pane
A: Make sure you're creating a new document based on the template, not just opening the template file.
Q: The footnotes aren't formatting correctly
A: Ensure you're using Word's built-in footnote feature (Insert → Footnote) rather than manually creating superscript numbers.
Q: The page size isn't 6" × 9"
A: Check Page Layout → Size and select Custom Size to verify dimensions.
FAQ
Q: Can I use this on macOS?
A: Yes, both the Word template and HTML formatter work identically on Windows and macOS.
Q: Do I need an internet connection?
A: No, all tools work offline once downloaded.
Q: Can I customize the styles?
A: Yes, you can modify the template styles to match your specific needs.
Q: Is there an automated way to apply styles?
A: The JavaScript tool adds heading markers (# ## ###) to make it easier to find and apply styles, but you'll need to apply them manually in Word.
